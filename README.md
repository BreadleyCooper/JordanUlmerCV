**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal Profile</span>**

Freelance web developer with a 10-year background as a Senior Healthcare Scientist in the NHS. I've recently discovered how coding can fulfill my want to create something tangible from an idea. Over the past decade, I have honed a deep set of soft skills and a high level of professionalism and work ethic. Since discovering my attraction to coding and software I'm now striving to transfer my skills and create exceptional software. I’m particularly interested in the front-end. I'm keen, eager to learn and ready to transition into tech.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Experience</span>**

**ToDo App (*WIP*)-** [https://breadleycooper.github.io/todolist/](https://breadleycooper.github.io/todolist/)  \
(repo: [BreadleyCooper/todolist (github.com)](https://github.com/BreadleyCooper/todolist))

**HTML, CSS, JS - an app to create ToDos and filter them by priority, due date and project**



* Object manipulation
* DOM manipulation 
* Local storage management using JSON data

Further strengthened my knowledge of webpack, ES6 modules and OOP and vanilla JS. This is my largest project to date,  importance of maintaining  clean code base became very apparent. I used modules to separate my code into more manageable chunks.

**Jamaican Grill House Website  - [ https://jamaicangrillhouse.netlify.app](https://jamaicangrillhouse.netlify.app/)** \
(repo: [BreadleyCooper/Restaurant-page (github.com)](https://github.com/BreadleyCooper/Restaurant-page))

**HTML, CSS, JS, Webpack, hosted on Netlify - A commercial project for a new local restaurant (discussion with the business owner in place to procure site)**



* Using webpack and node(npm) to bundle assets
* ES6 modules
* Commercial hosting and deployment using Netilfy

This project taught me how powerful webpack is and how bundling source code from separate files can significantly improve the cleanliness of my code and I can see how this would make scalability much easier. I plan on learning more about good UI/UX and accessibility to improve my future projects.

**Noughts and crosses** - [https://breadleycooper.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/](https://breadleycooper.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/)

(Repo:[https://github.com/BreadleyCooper/TOP-TicTacToe](https://github.com/BreadleyCooper/TOP-TicTacToe))

**HTML, CSS, JS - a game of noughts and crosses, demonstrating my understanding of fundamental programming theory as well as my eye for simple clean designs**



* Clean  global scope and modular revealing pattern to prevent ‘hacking’ or cheating
* Use of objects 
* Responsive design

This project had me thinking over the logic for hours on end. It improved my thought process as a programmer as I had to approach this with more of a problem-solving ideology than my previous projects. I would like to go back and include an opponent ‘AI’ when my programming skills have advanced.

Film photography,  film cameras, and landscape photography. More so digital photography now unfortunately since the price of film has blown up, plus it’s not very good for the environment. I love taking my camera out on a long walk and capturing the British countryside.
